Eventbrite Tickets extends The Events Calendar with all the basic Eventbrite controls without ever leaving WordPress.

== Description ==

Looking to track attendees, sell tickets and more? Eventbrite is a free service that provides the full power of a conference ticketing system. This plugin adds the ticket-selling abilities of Eventbrite to your Events Calendar events. You can import Eventbrite events into your calendar, or make events in WordPress and link them to their Eventbrite counterparts. Your users can see tickets right on your event page, and easily buy them through Eventbrite. Don't have an Eventbrite account? No problem, use the following link to set one up: <a href='http://www.eventbrite.com/r/etp'>http://www.eventbrite.com/r/etp</a>.

= The Events Calendar: Eventbrite Tickets =

* Sell tickets from your event's page via Eventbrite
* Create tickets in your WordPress dashboard
* Import Eventbrite events by ID

If you make a new account with Eventbrite, please use our referral code: <a href='http://www.eventbrite.com/r/etp'>http://www.eventbrite.com/r/etp</a>.

== Installation ==

= Install =

Just follow these steps:

1. From the dashboard of your site, navigate to Plugins --> Add New.
2. Select the Upload option and hit "Choose File."
3. When the popup appears select the the-events-calendar-eventbrite-tickets.x.x.zip file from your desktop. (The 'x.x' will change depending on the current version number).
4. Follow the on-screen instructions and wait as the upload completes.
5. When it's finished, activate the plugin via the prompt. A message will show confirming activation was successful.
6. For access to new updates, make sure you have added your valid License Key under Events --> Settings --> Licenses.

= Activate =

After downloading and installing the plugin, you'll need to add you Eventbrite App Key + Client Secret to activate all of the great Eventbrite Tickets features. This is how the system knows to link your WordPress site with your Eventbrite account.

1. Install and activate the latest version of The Events Calendar alongside Eventbrite Tickets v 3.9.6 or newer.
2. In another tab, log into Eventbrite.com — if you don’t already have an account, create one.
3. Within Eventbrite.com, navigate to the Account page and find App Management towards the bottom of the lefthand sidebar.
4. Hit the appropriate button to create a new app, and fill in the fields appropriately. Contact Information asks for basic information about who you are and should be quick to complete.
5. Application Details ask you to provide information specific to the app you’re creating. Here’s a quick guide to what goes in each:
** Application URL: The frontend URL for the WordPress site where you’ll be running the plugin.
** OAuth Redirect URI: This field doesn’t have a red asterisk, but it IS required to get Eventbrite Tickets working properly. If you don’t know what it is, don’t worry: just navigate to Events —> Settings —> Eventbrite on the dashboard of your site, and copy the OAuth Redirect URL we’ve provided for you.
** Application Name and Application Description should have a straightforward name and summary that will make this app easy to identify as your list of apps within Eventbrite.com grows over time.
6. Agree to the terms of service, and click the big green “Create Key” button. Let the system work its magic and wait to be redirected back to your App Management page.
7. You’ll see the key you just created, along with a link to view your client secret. First copy the key and plug it into the “Application Key” field under Events —> Settings —> Eventbrite on your WordPress site, then do the same for the “Client Secret.”
8. When all is said and done, hit Save Changes and let the page reload. But you’re not done yet!
9. Once the page refreshes and the App Key and Client Secret are saved in the system, you’ll notice a “Get Authorization” button that wasn’t previously showing.
10. Click it, and wait to be redirected to a page on Eventbrite.com asking you to allow or deny the authorization.
11. Allow it, wait a moment, and you’ll be redirected back to Events —> Settings —> Eventbrite on your WordPress site, with a “Success” message confirming that you’re good to go.

That’s it! If you are unsure about the process of want to see a video documenting it, see our knowledgebase article on the App Key / Client Secret process at http://m.tri.be/vr.

== Upgrade Notice ==

IMPORTANT NOTICE: 3.11.1 is a massive update from the 3.9 build, which contains a number of changes under-the-hood. All users are encouraged to backup their site before updating, and to apply the updates on a staging/test site where they can check on + fix customizations as needed before deploying to production.

Also note: 3.9.6 was a major update to Eventbrite Tickets: in that version we moved to the latest Eventbrite API, which results in some noticeable changes for end users. Most notably, all site admins - both new and existing users - will need to create an App Key / Client Secret within Eventbrite before they can begin using version 3.9.6. For an overview of the Application creation process, see our tutorial at http://m.tri.be/vr.
